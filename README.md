# Colour_filtering
This repository has the code implementation of my medium article, "Colour Filtering and Colour Pop Effects using OpenCV Python".
To run the application, clone this repository in your local machine and run,

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the required libraries in your machine or environment. After installing the required libraries, run,

```
python colfilt_kivy.py
```
